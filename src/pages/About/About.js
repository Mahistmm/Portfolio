      <p>
        Recently, I have done my full-stack course in a private institution.
        Proficient in programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
        as well as frameworks such as React and Node.js, completed several
        projects during in my course program, including a web application for
        hospital management tasks and an Amazon clone using React, Node.js and
        mongoDB. Highly motivated, with excellent problem-solving skills and a
        strong work ethic. Eager to learn and grow as a full-stack developer.
